Assignment #1
Fork https://github.com/brendenwest/itc298-s16 
Clone the resulting repo to your development computer
Install Node.js on your development computer
Create a basic server application with the following files in the root directory:
index.js 	- to launch the server and respond to requests
package.json 	- with information about your application
And the following file in a ‘public’ sub-folder:
home.html 	- with any HTML you want to display for the home page
index.js should send different information for these scenarios:
http://localhost:3000/ 		- returns the home.html page
http://localhost:3000/about     - returns information about your app
Returns a 404 status and error message for any other requests
Once ready, push these files to your github repo. The first two should be in the root directory and ‘home.html’ should be in a ‘public’ sub-directory
Submit the main url of your github repo to Canvas
